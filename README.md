# viis-Lazyvim

### This is no longer the exact Neovim config I use (see [my current dev-env](https://github.com/JackDerksen/dev-env)), but I still think it's a good building block on top of LazyVim.

This is my perfected Neovim configuration, built on top of [Lazyvim](https://www.lazyvim.org/), and designed to pair nicely with my [Tmux setup](https://github.com/JackDerksen/tmux).

Dependencies should be the same as stock Lazyvim.

### Key plugins include:
 - Harpoon for blazingly fast file switching
 - Oil for file navigation
 - Zen and Twilight for more focused programming
 - Undotree for time traveling
 - Duck.nvim just for fun (I've replaced the duck with a squirrel)


### Plus a whole bunch of awesome keymaps!
 - `shift + k` and `shift + j` while in visual mode to move a block of code up and down (with smart indenting, thanks for this one, Prime)
 - `<leader> + y` to yank to the system clipboard
 - `<leader> + s` for easy search and replace
 - `ctrl + h/j/k/l` for seamless Tmux window navigation
 - `<leader> + e` to toggle a floating Oil window
 - `<leader> + ;` to spawn a squirrel amigo
 - `<leader> + ;;` to kill your new squirrel amigo, you monster!
 - And more!

### I've also disabled some stock Lazyvim plugins that I find annoying:
- Nvim-notify
- Bufferline
- Neo-tree

### Most background colours have been made transparent. You can use whatever terminal background colour or transparency you want for a seamless and sexy af appearance!

In the screenshots above, I'm using Arch through WSL in the Windows Terminal. My font is [Jetbrains Mono Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads), and the background colour of my terminal is #1E1D23, or rgb(30, 29, 35).
